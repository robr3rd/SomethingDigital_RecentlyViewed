Inspired by Ivan Chepurnyi's [talk about improving Magento write performance](de.slideshare.net/ivanchepurnyi/making-magento-flying-like-a-rocket-a-set-of-valuable-tips-for-developers?related=1). This replaces the in-built Recently Viewed product block with a localstorage implementation.

Features

- Target the location of the block in admin via CSS selector
- Control the number of items displayed (uses default Magento value)
- Disable writes to report tables (recommended to use in conjuction with [Quafzi_PerformanceTweaks](https://github.com/quafzi/magento-performance-tweaks)
